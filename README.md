# Reaclux Boilerplate

A React Redux Webpack Gulp Sass Boilerplate

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Clone the repository to your local environment, install any dependencies and install the packages. Run the development command to start a local server, run the build command to create a new version for release.

### Prerequisities

```
NodeJS + NPM
```

### Installing

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

### Development

```
gulp dev
```

### Test runner

```
gulp test
```

### Build architecture

Find the source code under the `src` directory for javascript and `sass` for the stylesheets. Before modifying ensure that the development watcher is running by running the development watch command (see development notes). The `dist` directory holds the files ready for distribution.
